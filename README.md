Google Voice text message parser

This is a simple script to parse Google Voice text messages into an HTML chatlog file. It's a bit of a hack, but it works.

Usage

Using nodejs, run the script with the following command:

node parse.js

The script will prompt you for the path to your Google Voice text messages. It will then parse the messages and output an HTML file. The HTML file will be saved in the same directory as the script.
