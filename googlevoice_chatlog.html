<!-- The language is html, but it's not a web page. It's a chat log.
The chat log is a series of messages, each of which is a series of lines, displayed in the order they were sent, in the style of MSN Messenger. -->
<!-- The first line of each message is the sender's name, followed by a colon. -->
<!-- The second line of each message is the time the message was sent, in the format "HH:MM:SS AM/PM". -->
<!-- The third line of each message is the date the message was sent, in the format "MM/DD/YYYY". -->
<!-- The fourth line of each message is the message itself. -->
<!-- The fifth line of each message is a blank line. -->

<!-- The first line of the file is the name of the person who sent the first message. -->

<!-- This code converts google takeout data from googlevoice.json that was generated earlier into a chat log. -->

<!-- The code is written in JavaScript. 
The file "googlevoice.json" is then used by the extension to create the file "googlevoice.js"
Which is the used to create the file "googlevoice.html", to display the Google Voice chat history in a browser -->
